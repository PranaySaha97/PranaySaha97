## Hello ðŸ‘‹,

I am [Pranay Saha](https://pranaysaha97.github.io/). I am a Bangalore, India based software engineer. 

I am a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong>. Designing applications and understanding the mechanism of how these applications work under the hood is the most intriguing part of being a full stack developer to me. Although, I mainly work on MEAN stack, but I have also worked with ReactJS and Django.

Apart from making applications, I also like <strong>Data Analysis</strong>. It always surprises me how a little amount of data can give so much information. They are the best story tellers. Kaggle is my go to place for data exploration. I use python for my EDA projects. Some of the platforms I like to use are Kaggle notebooks, Jupyter Lab and Google Colab.

<strong>Machine learning</strong>, as a domain have always been one of my favorites. I have been researching and making several ML models, since 2017. I am more interested in Convolutional Neural Networks and how they work with different libraries and algorithms to make wonders. I have been keen to know about computer vision and speech recognition. However, anything about AI and ML is amazing.

Among my <strong>hobbies</strong>, I like listening to music, audiobooks, and watching movies. Few of my favorite books are Ikigai & Atomic Habit. My favorite movie series includes, Harry Potter & The lord of the rings. I like travelling to new places. Road trips give me immense pleasure. And how can I forget to tell how much I love culturally diverse food.
